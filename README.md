# Automated Extraction of Medical Risk Factors For Life Insurance Underwriting

Life insurance underwriting considers an applicant’s medical risk factors, usually provided inside free-text documents. New insurance-specific Natural Language Processing (NLP) models can automatically extract material medical history and risk factors from such documents. This joint Solution Accelerator with John Snow Labs makes it easy to implement this in practice – enabling a faster, more consistent, and more scalable underwriting experience. This tutorial will cover:
- The end-to-end solution architecture on Databricks, from data ingestion to dashboarding
- Easily analyze free-text documents to extract medical history & risk factors using NLP
- Executable Python notebooks implementing the solution that you can start from today

We will get the following list of medical risk factors from unstructured clinical notes using Spark NLP models and tools and make analysis on the results.<br>

## Instruction
To run this accelerator, set up JSL Partner Connect [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/integrations/ml/john-snow-labs.html#connect-to-john-snow-labs-using-partner-connect), [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/integrations/ml/john-snow-labs#--connect-to-john-snow-labs-using-partner-connect) and navigate to **My Subscriptions** tab. Make sure you have a valid subscription for the workspace you clone this repo into, then **install on cluster** as shown in the screenshot below, with the default options. You will receive an email from JSL when the installation completes.
